In 3 ways you can assign a specific pod to the specific node

1. Taint should be applied to the node
Toleration should be mention in the deployment file
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
2. Label should be applied to the node
nodeSelector should be mention in the deployment file
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx

3 . Node affinity 
Label the Node
spec:

    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
